<h2 id="content">Â¿How do i describe myself?</h2>
<p>I consider myself an enthusiastic person about the world of technology. I love learning new things not only related to technology. I am an introverted person, but if someone talks to me, I won't stop chatting. I am very passionate about rock, classical, metal, and electronic music. And now I'm getting into the world of sports; I like to exercise as another way to de-stress and feel better about myself. I am an easy-going person, and if people open up to me, they can find a friend. Something that can accurately describe me is that I can't leave doubts in the air, and I always look for ways to solve problems that arise, both personally and technically in my career. And although I love my country Guatemala, I would like to someday visit other countries like Germany, mainly because I am a fan of Bayern Munich and I love European football.</p>
