					<h3>Home transfer switch</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In this project i design a circuit that let me switch between the electrical supply from my home and
the supply provided by a battery in DC (using an AC oscillator and a transformer). This with the objective of
restoring the power supply to a circuit in a quick and safe way.</p>

					<h3>Newton-Raphson multivariable in a microcontroller</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As part of a numerical methods course I took, I learned this method, which is most useful when you have, for example, a matrix of equations that model the joints of a robot. Since by means of this method the angles of the joints can be found to position the tool of a robot in a certain position; as well as their linear and angular velocities. The method was developed in C language for a Texas Instruments microcontroller.</p>

					<h3>Example of set and reset using FactoryIO and TIA PORTAL</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This is an example of how to connect TIA PORTAL, using PLC_SIM, with FactoryIO. In this case i used the program
FactoryIO to design a 3D scene to test the functionalaty of the program i developed in TIA PORTAL using ladder as the programming language of the project. This can help some people who has a problem or doubt with the realization of this
type of simulation.</p>

					<h3>Car for drawing pictures</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This project was created for a university class on assembly language. It features a two-wheeled car that draws pictures by moving around. The car's movements are programmed to create specific shapes and patterns. And all was developed for the microcontroller TM4C123GH6PM.</p>
